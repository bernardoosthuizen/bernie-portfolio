## Reflection
I found inspiration from Windows NT and my love of pixel art. The aim of this project was to create a space where I can show off future work and solidify foundational react.js knowledge. Most challenges faced were related to CSS. Minor challenges were overcome quickly, making this project eductational and fun.
